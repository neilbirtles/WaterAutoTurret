# 3D Printed Parts

All 3D printed parts were printed from PLA on a Prusa Mk3s, using standard settings. Only those parts that have their names appended with “(Supports Needed)” need supports enabled, all other parts have been designed specifically to be printed support free. All parts have been saved in the correct orientation for printing to simplify the process. As they can be added to your slicer of choice, sliced and printed. The variable layer height feature was used on all the parts to speed up the print time as there are quite a lot of parts to be printed!

On a well setup printer the parts will be of the correct size to fit together, with many of the parts being friction fit into the aluminum profiles and over the plastic tubing the barrel is constructed from. It is however usually worth pushing the parts designed to slot into the aluminum profiles through a spare piece of profile to make sure they are a tight but not unreasonable fit. Where the fit is too tight sliding them in and out of a aluminum profile a few times (with the help of a rubber mallet if needed!) will get them to the perfect fit.

File names for the stl files link back to body names in the Fusion360 model for the water turret so allow for easy identification. The following are the parts that need supports along with a suggested description of where the supports are needed. The Prusa Slicer support painter feature was used to limit the supports to where they were needed to avoid large amounts of unneeded support material that would need to be removed.

* Electronics Enclosure::[00 Electronics Enclosure Base (Supports Needed).stl](https://github.com/neilbirtles/WaterAutoTurret/blob/main/3D%20Printable%20Parts/Electronics%20Enclosure/00%20Electronics%20Enclosure%20Base%20(Supports%20Needed).stl) - supports only needed along the very top side (when orienting the part as saved, and the side that joins to the camera housing), all other areas can be masked off or have maximum 45 degree angles to allow supportless printing

* Turret Barrel Mount::[04 Barrel Microswitch Mount - Front (Supports Needed).stl](https://github.com/neilbirtles/WaterAutoTurret/blob/main/3D%20Printable%20Parts/Turret%20Barrel%20Mount/04%20Barrel%20Microswitch%20Mount%20-%20Front%20(Supports%20Needed).stl) - supports needed for at least the circular locator pins that hold the microswitch in place and the top edge. Usually just let the slicer add supports wherever it like for these parts. Just need to be careful when removing them to avoid breaking the locator pins. 

* Turret Barrel Mount::[05 Barrel Microswitch Mount - Rear (Supports Needed).stl](https://github.com/neilbirtles/WaterAutoTurret/blob/main/3D%20Printable%20Parts/Turret%20Barrel%20Mount/05%20Barrel%20Microswitch%20Mount%20-%20Rear%20(Supports%20Needed).stl) - as front microswitch mount above.

* Turret Base::[02 Internal Limit Switch Holder - Left (Supports Needed).stl](https://github.com/neilbirtles/WaterAutoTurret/blob/main/3D%20Printable%20Parts/Turret%20Base/02%20Internal%20Limit%20Switch%20Holder%20-%20Left%20(Supports%20Needed).stl) - as front microswitch mount above.

* Turret Base::[03 Internal Limit Switch Holder - Right (Supports Needed).stl](https://github.com/neilbirtles/WaterAutoTurret/blob/main/3D%20Printable%20Parts/Turret%20Base/03%20Internal%20Limit%20Switch%20Holder%20-%20Right%20(Supports%20Needed).stl) - as front microswitch mount above.

* Turret Base::[09 Water and Power Inlet (Supports Needed).stl](https://github.com/neilbirtles/WaterAutoTurret/blob/main/3D%20Printable%20Parts/Turret%20Base/09%20Water%20and%20Power%20Inlet%20(Supports%20Needed).stl) - can either pick supports to build plate only or paint on supports down the both sides to support the parts that slot into the aluminum profiles. 

The use of all the 3D printed parts can be found in the rest of the build guide and also in the Fusion360 model. All the 3D printed parts are stored [here](https://github.com/neilbirtles/WaterAutoTurret/tree/main/3D%20Printable%20Parts)
