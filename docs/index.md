# Water Auto Turret 

This is the design for a fully automatic water turret that will track people and fire water at them when in range. It is intended to be a toy for children in the summer! Its constructed from a mix of 3D printed parts, aluminium extrusions and various other off the shelf items. The unit is powered by a 12v lead acid battery and plugs into a standard hosepipe push on connector for its water supply. It uses a Khadas VIM3 board to control everything and uses the onboard NPU to accelerate the object tracking.

Full design information is provided (including a complete bill of materials), along with some basic assembly guides so that anyone should be able to build one
